rc_genicam_driver for ROS2
--------------------------

ROS2 driver to configure a [Roboception](https://roboception.com)
[rc_visard](https://roboception.com/rc_visard)
or [rc_cube](https://roboception.com/product/rc_cube-s/) and receive images.

Please also consult the manuals for more details:

* https://doc.rc-visard.com
* https://doc.rc-cube.com

### GenICam GenTL Transport Layer

The rc_genicam_driver uses [rc_genicam_api](https://github.com/roboception/rc_genicam_api)
for interfacing with the rc_visard or rc_cube via GenICam/GigE Vision and requires a
transport layer called a GenTL producer (shared library with the suffix `.cti`).
For convenience rc_genicam_api comes with producers from Baumer for common
architectures.

The path to the producer can be set with the `GENICAM_GENTL64_PATH`
environment variable (or `GENICAM_GENTL32_PATH` for 32 bit systems).
If not set, rc_genicam_driver will fall back to searching for the Baumer
producer where rc_genicam_api is installed.

If the producer .cti can't be found and you will get an error message like
```
[ERROR] [1512568083.512790905]: No transport layers found in path /opt/ros/melodic/lib/rc_genicam_api
```

In this case you need either need to actually install rc_genicam_api properly or
set the environment variable when running it. E.g. export:

```bash
GENICAM_GENTL64_PATH=/path/to/rc_genicam_api/baumer/Ubuntu-18.04/x86_64
```

Configuration
-------------

#### Read-only parameters

Parameters to be set to the ROS param server before run-time.

* `device`: The ID of the device, e.g. Roboception rc_visard sensor or rc_cube.
  This can be either the

  * serial number, e.g. `02912345`

    IMPORTANT: preceed with a colon (`:02912345`) when passing this on the commandline or
    setting it via rosparam (see https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues/1339).
    This is not neccessary when specifying it as a string in a launch file.

  * user defined name (factory default is the name of the rc_visard's model), must be unique among all
    reachable sensors

  * internal ID, which is generated by the used GenTL producer. Often, this ID
    contains the MAC address in some way. This ID can change with the
    implementation of the transport layer.

  See https://github.com/roboception/rc_genicam_api#device-id for more details.
  By default this parameter is set to `*`, which works with if only one
  compatible device can be found on the network.

#### At runtime changeable parameters

These parameters can be changed during runtime. Parameters will not be declared
if they are not available on the device. This can happen if the device firmware
is old and does not offer the parameter.

* `ptp_enabled`: Enable PTP slave (PrecisionTimeProtocol, IEEE1588)

* `camera_fps`: Frames per second that are published by this node.
  Publishing frames will be slowed down depending on this setting. Setting
  it higher than the real framerate of the specific device has no effect.

* `camera_exp_auto`: If true, then the exposure time is chosen automatically,
  up to exp_max as maximum. If false, then exp_value is used as exposure
  time in seconds.

* `camera_exp_auto_mode`
  Auto-exposure mode which can be "Normal", "Out1High" or "AdaptiveOut1".
  Default: Normal.

* `camera_exp_max`: Maximum exposure time in seconds if exp_auto is true.

* `camera_exp_auto_average_max`: The auto exposure tries to set the exposure
  time and gain factor such that the average image intensity is between an
  upper and a lower bound. This parameter defines the upper bound. It can be
  reached if there is no saturation (e.g. due to reflections).

* `camera_exp_auto_average_min`: See `camera_exp_auto_average_max`. This
  parameter defines the lower bound. The average image intensity can be
  reduced to this value to reduce or avoid saturation (e.g. due to
  reflections).

* `camera_exp_value`: Exposure time in seconds if exp_auto is false.

* `camera_gain_value`: Gain factor in decibel if exp_auto is false.

* Auto exposure region: Definition of a region in the left image,
  if the region has zero size or is outside the image,
  then the full left and right image is used to determine the auto exposure.
  * `camera_exp_width`: Width of auto exposure region. 0 for whole image.
  * `camera_exp_height`: Height of auto exposure region. 0 for whole image.
  * `camera_exp_offset_x`: First column of auto exposure region
  * `camera_exp_offset_y`: First row of auto exposure region

* `depth_acquisition_mode`: Can be either `SingleFrame` or `Continuous`. Only
  the first letter will be checked, thus giving `S` or `C` is sufficient.

* `depth_quality`: Quality can be "Low", "Medium", "High" and "Full". Only the first
  letter will be checked, thus specification of "L", "M", "H" or "F" is
  sufficient. The quality setting effectively downscales the image after
  the downscale factor as given above:

  + Full does not downscale the image, i.e. factor is 1 (e.g. 1280x960).
    NOTE: This mode requires the 'stereo_plus' license on the rc_visard.
  + High downscales by factor 2 (e.g. 640x480).
  + Medium downscales by factor 4 (e.g. 320x240).
  + Low downscales by factor 6 (e.g. 214x160).

* `depth_static_scene`: This parameter can be set to true if the scene and
  camera is static. It only has an effect if quality is either High or Full.
  If active, input images are accumulated and averaged for 300 ms to reduce
  noise. This limits the frame rate to a maximum of 3 Hz. The timestamp of
  the disparity image is taken from the first image that was used for
  accumulation.

* `depth_fill`: Higher numbers fill gaps with measurments with potentielly
  higher errors.

* `depth_seg`: Maximum size of isolated disparity regions that will be
  invalidated, related to full resolution.

* `depth_smooth`: Switching smoothing of disparities on or off.
  NOTE: Smoothing requires the 'stereo_plus' license on the rc_visard.

* `depth_minconf`: Minimal confidence. All disparities with lower confidence
  will be set to invalid.

* `depth_mindepth`: Minimum depth in meter. All disparities with lower depth
  will be set to invalid.

* `depth_maxdepth`: Maximum depth in meter. All disparities with higher depth
  will be set to invalid.

* `depth_maxdeptherr`: Maximum depth error in meter. All disparities with a
  higher depth error will be set to invalid.

* `depth_exposure_adapt_timeout`: Maximum time in seconds to wait after triggering
  in SingleFrame modes until auto exposure has finished adjustments.

* `out1_mode`: Mode for the digital GPIO out1. Possible values are:

  * `Low` for switching out1 permanently off.
  * `High` for switching out1 permanently on.
  * `ExposureActive` for switching out1 on for the exposure time of every
    image.
  * `ExposureAlternateActive` for switching out1 on for the exposure time of
    every second image.

  The value can only be changed if the rc_visard has an `IO Control` license.
  The default is `Low`.

* `out2_mode`: Mode for the digital GPIO out2. The functionality is the same
  as for `out1_mode`. The default is `Low`.

For color sensors, the following dynamic-reconfigure parameters are additionally
available:

* `camera_wb_auto`: If true, then white balancing is done automatically. If
  false, then the red and blue to green ratios can be chosen manually.

* `camera_wb_ratio_red`: Red to green ratio for color balancing if
  `camera_wb_auto` is false.

* `camera_wb_ratio_blue`: Blue to green ratio for color balancing if
  `camera_wb_auto` is false.

If the connected rc_visard has an `IO Control` license, then the following
topics are additionally provided for images where the GPIO out1 is either low
or high. These topics only useful if `out1_mode` is set to the special mode
`ExposureAlternateActive`.

* /stereo/left/image_rect_out1_low (sensor_msgs::Image, MONO8)
* /stereo/left/image_rect_out1_high (sensor_msgs::Image, MONO8)
* /stereo/right/image_rect_out1_low (sensor_msgs::Image, MONO8)

#### Running multiple rc_visard's in one ros environment

For operating multiple rc_visard's in one ros environment, each ros node must
be started in separate namespaces, e.g., `my_visard`. As a result, all
frame_ids in all ros messages will be prefixed, e.g., to `my_visard_world` or
`my_visard_camera`.

Services
--------

The following service is offered to trigger stereo matching in `SingleFrame`
mode. It returns an error if the `depth_acquisition_mode` is `Continuous`.

* `depth_acquisition_trigger`

Diagnostics
-----------

The rc_genicam_driver uses the `diagnostics_updater` class from the
[ROS diagnostics stack](https://wiki.ros.org/diagnostics) to regularly publish a
[DiagnosticStatus Message](http://docs.ros.org/api/diagnostic_msgs/html/msg/DiagnosticStatus.html).

The regular publishing rate can be set via the `diagnostic_updater.period` parameter and defaults to 1 second.

Currently two status are published:

- `Device`: Information about the device that the driver is connected to. It covers
  the device serial number, mac address, user-defined GeV ID, and the firmware image
  version.

- `Connection`: Status of the current connection between rc_genicam_driver and device.
It publishes 4 different messages:

  - `Disconnected` (Error): The driver is currently not (yet) connected to the sensor and
  might try to reconnect several times according to the `max_reconnects` parameter.
  - `Idle` (Ok): The driver is connected but not publishing any data because
  no one is subscribed to any.
  - `No data` (Warning): The driver is connected and required to publish data but
  itself does not receive any data from the sensor.
  - `Streaming` (Ok): The driver is connected and properly streaming data.

  The published status values are `connection_loss_total`,
  `incomplete_buffers_total`, `image_receive_timeouts_total`, and
  `current_reconnect_trial`. If not `Disconnected`, additionally the current
  `ip_address` and `gev_packet_size` are published.

Launching
---------

* Run as node using command line parameters:
  ```bash
  ros2 run rc_genicam_driver rc_genicam_driver --ros-args -p "device:=:02912345"
  ```
* Run as component with command line parameters:
  ```bash
  ros2 component standalone rc_genicam_driver rc::GenICamDriver -p "device:=:02912345"
  ```
* In a separate **namespace**:
  ```bash
  run rc_genicam_driver rc_genicam_driver --ros-args -p "device:=:02912345" -r __ns:=/my_visard
  ```
  Note that in this setup all frame_ids in all ros messages will be prefixed
  with `my_visard`, e.g., the frame_id of the published camera images will
  be `my_visard_camera`.
